# 50-State Survey of Regulation of Token Sales Under State Money Transmission Laws

Doing an ICO or an airdrop soon? You must be careful of money transmission  laws. 

My blockchain startup, Mobius, recently conducted a $39 million token sale. But, given that the rules for token sales in the U.S. are still in flux, we had to do a lot of legal research before launching our sale. And we ended up excluding would-be buyers in six states: Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, Vermont, and Washington.

In approaching our sale, we talked to countless elite law firms and Big 4 accounting firms to recruit the best team to guide us through this process. Here, we pass on Paul Hasting's 50-State Survey of Regulation of Token Sales Under State Money Transmission Laws, last updated November 2017. Please note that this does not cover securities, tax, consumer protection, and other concerns. 

Also, please note that Coin Center's 50 State Regulatory Analysis (https://coincenter.org/page/state-digital-currency-regulatory-tracker) and other informational documents may also be valuable for learning about the US state-by-state regulatory landscape.
