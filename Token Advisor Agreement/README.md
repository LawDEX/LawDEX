### Advisor Agreement

Many token projects engage with advisors to guide them in their token projects. This agreement helps to formalize advisor relationships. This agreement is a variation of the Founder Advisor Standard Template (FAST) agreement (https://fi.co/FAST), modified such that advisors receive tokens instead of equity as compensation. The agreement also includes an optional token lockup clause.

As always, please refer to the Terms and Conditions in the LawDEX repo before using this resource or any other LawDEX resource.
