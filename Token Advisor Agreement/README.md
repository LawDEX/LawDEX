# Advisor Agreement

Many token projects engage advisors to guide them in their token projects. This agreement helps to formalize advisor relationships. This agreement is a variation of the [Founder Advisor Standard Template (FAST) agreement](https://fi.co/FAST), modified such that advisors receive tokens instead of equity as compensation. The agreement also includes an optional token lockup clause.
