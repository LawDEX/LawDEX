###Advisor Agreement

Many token projects engage with advisors to guide them in their token projecs. This agreement helps to formalize advisor relationships and set expectations. This agreement is a variation of the FAST agreement (https://fi.co/FAST), except modified such that advisors may only receive tokens in compensation. Projects may elect to include an optional lockup period. 

As always, please refer to the Terms and Conditions in the LawDEX repo before using this resource or any other LawDEX resource.
