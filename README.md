# What is LawDEX?

## LawDEX is an open-source repository of legal documents for blockchain developers. 

### Why do we believe that LawDEX is necessary? 

We believe the current state of legal advisory for blockchain projects is (generally speaking): (1) prohibitively expensive for developers and bootstrapping entrepreneurs, and (2) fragmented and inconsistent in terms of opinions and advice from different lawyers. In creating LawDEX, we hope to open-source legal documents and knowledge for the following benefits: 

* Open-source legal resources for blockchain developers will help drive legal costs down because it’ll lessen the need for lawyers and entrepreneurs to reinvent the wheel when it comes to approaches and research. 
* Open-source legal resources will create a transparent “decentralized” ecosystem of legal opinions that lawyers and users can learn from and build upon. 
* Open-source legal resources will incentivize more entrepreneurs and developers to enter the space by reducing uncertainty and confusion. 

# Who can contribute? How do I contribute?

**If you’re a blockchain entrepreneur** and have retained legal counsel in the past to do research, please consider contributing informational resources and documents (with all confidential information removed) that could be general enough to be helpful to many.

**If you are a lawyer**, please consider contributing templates and articles that could help developers and entrepreneurs better understand the landscape. Potential subjects could include: securities frameworks, global and domestic money transmitter analyses, disclosure templates, AML/KYC approaches, and more. This is also a great way to show your support for blockchain's open-source ethos!

**Please email lawdexproject@gmail.com or submit a PR for contributions!**

Anyone who believes that some information is wrong or not updated should submit a pull request with updated information. We (and the blockchain community) are grateful for your help! 


# Terms and Conditions (AKA How to Use These Resources)

**These resources are not legal advice and are not a substitute for legal advice. Since this is an evolving area of the law, readers should not rely on the information to be true, accurate or complete at any given time.**

**These sources are provided as general informational resources.** Note that your business, technology, and operations are unique and likely will invoke different legal issues and considerations! 

Just like how you wouldn’t blindly duplicate and use an open source software repo for a $200 million company without auditing, understanding, or customizing the original code, you should not blindly use these documents without understanding and customizing them to your special circumstances. If you’re building a business, you will likely still need the help of a lawyer; using these documents will hopefully help you become a more informed client and lower your legal expenses.  

### Before using these resources, consider:
* **When was this document created?** If a document is old, note that the law may have shifted.
* **What was the fact pattern underlying this analysis?** Who was this written for, and under what context? Perhaps the analysis only applies to those in a specific situation. 
* **Who wrote this document?** Was it created by a BigLaw partner, or a graduate of Google-Twitter-Facebook Law School? Not to say the latter is always untrustworthy, but you should do extra verification.
* **Note the disclaimers in the document.** The document may not be suitable, accurate, or applicable for certain types of businesses, industries, and use cases. Make sure not to accidentally apply the wrong document 

By using any resource in LawDEX, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.
