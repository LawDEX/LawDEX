# How to Use These Resources

**These resources are not legal advice and are not a substitute for legal advice.** Your business, technology, and operations are unique and likely will invoke different legal issues and considerations! **These sources are provided as general informational resources.** If you’re building a business, you will likely still need the help of a lawyer; using these documents will hopefully help you become a more informed client and lower your legal expenses.  

Just like how you wouldn’t blindly duplicate and use an open source software repo for a $200 million company without auditing, understanding, or customizing the original code, you should not blindly use these documents without understanding and customizing them to your special circumstances. Note that customizing and understanding may require the input of a lawyer in your jurisdiction. 

### Before using these resources, consider:
* **When was this document created?** If a document is old, note that the law may have shifted.
* **What was the fact pattern underlying this analysis?** Who was this written for, and under what context? Perhaps the analysis only applies to those in a specific situation. 
* **Who wrote this document?** Was it created by a BigLaw partner, or a graduate of Google-Twitter-Facebook Law School? Not to say the latter is always untrustworthy, but you should do extra verification.
* **Note the disclaimers in the document.** The document may not be suitable, accurate, or applicable for certain types of businesses, industries, and use cases. Make sure not to accidentally apply the wrong document
